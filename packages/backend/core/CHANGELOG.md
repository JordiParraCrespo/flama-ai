# @flama/backend-core

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 7fdcefc: Capability registry: a missing optional key disables a feature instead of
  booting with a `'not-set'` sentinel.

  - `@flama/shared` exports `DEPLOYMENT_CAPABILITIES` / `DeploymentCapabilities`
    — the catalog of optional features a deployment may or may not have
    (`google_oauth`, `github_oauth`, `stripe_billing`, `s3_storage`,
    `email_delivery`), plus the `CLIENT_CAPABILITIES` wire subset.
  - `@flama/backend-core` gains a `CapabilitiesService` registry: the app
    resolves its capability set from config once at boot, logs it at startup,
    and every consumer asks the registry instead of comparing raw config against
    sentinel values.
  - The API's OAuth config keys are now genuinely optional
    (`z.string().optional()`) rather than defaulting to `'not-set'`; blank or
    whitespace-only env vars normalize to `undefined` across the optional
    OAuth/Stripe/S3/email keys. The client-facing subset of the resolved set
    (`CLIENT_CAPABILITIES`: the OAuth providers and `stripe_billing`) is served
    at `GET /health/capabilities` (exempt from scope checks, like other
    anonymous reads); server-internal capabilities stay in the startup log.
  - `@flama/api-client` picks up the generated `HealthApi.deploymentCapabilities()`.
  - `@flama/frontend` adds a `capabilities` module and a
    `useDeploymentCapabilities()` hook; the web login page uses it to render
    only configured social providers, and to name the env vars to set when none
    are (only after a successful read — an unreachable API or a failed refetch
    with retained stale data is not a missing configuration).

- af46e89: Bring every user-facing error into the RFC 7807 catalog.

  The organization and admin façades threw bare `HttpException`s carrying Better
  Auth's `{ message, code }` body, expecting the code to survive. It did not:
  `AllExceptionsFilter` reads a `code` from `AppError` alone, so ~46 call sites
  answered with a codeless problem document whose `title` was only the status
  phrase ("Conflict"). The auth guards had the same gap.

  - **`@flama/backend-core`** — new `ApiAuthProblemResponses()` documents the
    401/403 every guarded route can produce, applied once per controller class.
    A test now pins the deliberate rule that a bare `HttpException` carries no
    `code`.
  - **`apps/api`** — new `AuthErrors` (`AUTH_001`/`AUTH_002`), `OrganizationErrors`
    (`ORG_001`–`ORG_016`) and `AdminErrors` (`ADMIN_001`–`ADMIN_008`) catalogs.
    `betterAuthInvoker` folds Better Auth's ~85 upstream codes onto them, keeping
    the original as an `upstreamCode` extension member. Guards throw catalog
    errors instead of Nest's codeless ones; `PoliciesGuard` now reports a missing
    principal as 401 rather than 403.
  - **`@flama/translations`** — new `errors` namespace with a message per code in
    both locales, so clients stop rendering the server's English `detail`.
  - **`@flama/frontend`** — new `createErrorMessageResolver` translating a failure
    from its problem `code`; the organizations repository no longer swallows a
    failed read into an empty list.
  - **`@flama/api-client`** — regenerated; the documented failures now reach the
    OpenAPI document.

- b079e83: Logging hardening: `LoggingModule` in `@flama/backend-core` wraps `nestjs-pino`
  with hardened defaults — request log lines carry only known-safe fields (no
  headers, query strings, or bodies; credential headers redacted as a backstop) —
  and registers `UserContextInterceptor`, which attaches `userId` and the
  credential's effective scopes to the request log context once the auth guards
  resolve. `createAuthRouteLoggingMiddleware` brings the Better Auth
  `/api/auth/*` routes (mounted ahead of Nest's middleware) into the request log
  via the `middleware` option of `@thallesp/nestjs-better-auth`. The API also
  gains opt-in SQL query logging (`DB_LOG_QUERIES=true`) that never logs bound
  parameters.
- 07eb972: Serve every API error as an RFC 7807 problem document.

  `AllExceptionsFilter` now answers with `application/problem+json` and the
  standard members — `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail`, `instance` — plus the
  `code`, `correlationId`, `timestamp` and `invalidParams` extensions, instead of
  the ad-hoc `{ statusCode, code, message }` body.

  - **Title vs detail.** `AppError` takes a second argument: `detail` (specific to
    one occurrence) and `extensions` (extra members). The catalog message stays
    the stable problem `title`, so handlers no longer interpolate request data
    into it — `TOKEN_002` and `TOKEN_005` now report the offending scopes in
    `detail` and as `ungrantableScopes` / `missingScopes`.
  - **Validation failures** list every rejected field in `invalidParams`.
  - **Domain exceptions** from `@flama/backend-ddd` carry an `httpStatus`, so a
    `NotFoundException` surfaces as 404 rather than a blanket 500.
  - **5xx responses** no longer echo the underlying message; the correlation id
    ties the response to the logged stack trace.
  - `type` URIs point at the new error reference (`https://flama.dev/errors`),
    configurable per deployment with `ERROR_TYPE_BASE_URL`.

  The `ProblemDetails` wire type lives in `@flama/shared`, replacing the unused
  `ApiErrorResponse`. The CLI and MCP clients
  read problem documents (still understanding the old body shape), `@flama/frontend`
  exposes `toAppError` and the `@MapApiError` method decorator so screens can show
  the server's `detail` and per-field errors, and `ApiProblemResponse` puts the
  schema in the OpenAPI document and the generated client.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- aa0eefd: Refactor the API toward Domain-Driven Hexagon architecture.

  - Add `@flama/backend-ddd`, a building-blocks package with `Entity`,
    `AggregateRoot`, `ValueObject`, `DomainEvent`, `CommandBase`, `QueryBase`,
    the `RepositoryPort`/`Paginated` abstractions, a domain/persistence/response
    `Mapper` interface, domain exceptions and `Guard`.
  - Restructure the users module into vertical slices (`commands/`, `queries/`,
    `domain/`, `database/`, `dtos/`, `application/`) on top of `@nestjs/cqrs`,
    with a `UserEntity` aggregate, an `Email` value object, a
    `UserRepositoryPort` and its TypeORM adapter, and domain-event publishing.
  - Invert the `@flama/backend-ddd` ↔ `@flama/backend-core` layering: the
    framework-free `RequestContextService` and the `ErrorDefinition` contract now
    live in `@flama/backend-ddd` (re-exported from `@flama/backend-core` for
    backwards compatibility), so the domain layer depends on no infrastructure.
  - Document the architecture in `apps/api/ARCHITECTURE.md`, add a
    `/scaffold-module` skill, and enforce the layer boundaries with
    dependency-cruiser (`pnpm arch`, wired into CI and a Stop hook).
