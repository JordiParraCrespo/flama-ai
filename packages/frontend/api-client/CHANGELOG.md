# @flama/api-client

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 548b754: Stripe billing leaves the starter for the `billing` plugin, and the `leads`
  example is removed.

  - `@flama/api` no longer ships `BillingModule`, its migrations, the `stripe`
    config or the `stripe` dependency, and no longer ships `LeadsModule`.
    `pnpm plugin:add billing` puts billing back, then
    `pnpm generate:api-client`.
  - `@flama/shared` drops the `billing` and `leads` scope resources and
    permission groups, the `stripe_billing` capability, the `Billing` subject,
    the `/billing/subscriptions` endpoint policy and the billing and lead schemas.
  - `@flama/api-client` drops the billing and leads endpoints and models. Its
    legacy models now take `Scope`, `ScopeResource` and `ClientCapabilities` from
    `@flama/shared` instead of spelling them out. `openapi-ts` reads
    `apps/api/openapi.json` from the right path again, so `src/generated` is
    regenerated.
  - `@flama/translations` drops the `BILLING_*` and `LEAD_*` error copy; the
    plugin carries the billing copy.
  - `@flama/web`'s permission picker gives a resource without an icon of its own
    a generic key icon, so a plugin's scope group renders without an edit here.

- d532ef4: Enforce conditional User permissions against the loaded record before reading
  or updating it. Listing the global user directory now requires `manage User`.
  The shared `canAccess()` helper performs the instance-level check.

  Preserve the default role's existing restrictions: it has no platform User
  grants, and self-service edits go through `/profile`. The existing
  `TightenDefaultUserRole` migration already removes unconditional User grants;
  no earlier scoping migration is introduced, as that would cause those grants
  to survive the later tightening migration. Explicit conditional grants remain
  supported, and profile update schemas continue to exclude `role`.

  Non-admin callers that previously listed users with only `read User` now
  receive 403; organization-scoped member endpoints cover tenant directories.

### Minor Changes

- 7fdcefc: Capability registry: a missing optional key disables a feature instead of
  booting with a `'not-set'` sentinel.

  - `@flama/shared` exports `DEPLOYMENT_CAPABILITIES` / `DeploymentCapabilities`
    — the catalog of optional features a deployment may or may not have
    (`google_oauth`, `github_oauth`, `stripe_billing`, `s3_storage`,
    `email_delivery`), plus the `CLIENT_CAPABILITIES` wire subset.
  - `@flama/backend-core` gains a `CapabilitiesService` registry: the app
    resolves its capability set from config once at boot, logs it at startup,
    and every consumer asks the registry instead of comparing raw config against
    sentinel values.
  - The API's OAuth config keys are now genuinely optional
    (`z.string().optional()`) rather than defaulting to `'not-set'`; blank or
    whitespace-only env vars normalize to `undefined` across the optional
    OAuth/Stripe/S3/email keys. The client-facing subset of the resolved set
    (`CLIENT_CAPABILITIES`: the OAuth providers and `stripe_billing`) is served
    at `GET /health/capabilities` (exempt from scope checks, like other
    anonymous reads); server-internal capabilities stay in the startup log.
  - `@flama/api-client` picks up the generated `HealthApi.deploymentCapabilities()`.
  - `@flama/frontend-core` adds a `capabilities` module and a
    `useDeploymentCapabilities()` hook; the web login page uses it to render
    only configured social providers, and to name the env vars to set when none
    are (only after a successful read — an unreachable API or a failed refetch
    with retained stale data is not a missing configuration).

- c27a7f4: Port the rn-bedrock mobile stack into Flama: Expo SDK 57 + dev client, nitro-fetch, MMKV, Sentry/RevenueCat optional keys, gorhom sheet forks, Legend List, expo-image, nano-icons, hey-api client generation, and namespaced translation files.

  - `@flama/frontend-mobile` owns the shared mobile glue: the MMKV query
    persistence wrapper, the polyfills, `FormField` and SecureStore.
  - `@flama/frontend-core` gains `ConfigManager` under `@flama/frontend-core/config`.

- 07eb972: Serve every API error as an RFC 7807 problem document.

  `AllExceptionsFilter` now answers with `application/problem+json` and the
  standard members — `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail`, `instance` — plus the
  `code`, `correlationId`, `timestamp` and `invalidParams` extensions, instead of
  the ad-hoc `{ statusCode, code, message }` body.

  - **Title vs detail.** `AppError` takes a second argument: `detail` (specific to
    one occurrence) and `extensions` (extra members). The catalog message stays
    the stable problem `title`, so handlers no longer interpolate request data
    into it — `TOKEN_002` and `TOKEN_005` now report the offending scopes in
    `detail` and as `ungrantableScopes` / `missingScopes`.
  - **Validation failures** list every rejected field in `invalidParams`.
  - **Domain exceptions** from `@flama/backend-ddd` carry an `httpStatus`, so a
    `NotFoundException` surfaces as 404 rather than a blanket 500.
  - **5xx responses** no longer echo the underlying message; the correlation id
    ties the response to the logged stack trace.
  - `type` URIs point at the new error reference (`https://flama.dev/errors`),
    configurable per deployment with `ERROR_TYPE_BASE_URL`.

  The `ProblemDetails` wire type lives in `@flama/shared`, replacing the unused
  `ApiErrorResponse`. The CLI and MCP clients
  read problem documents (still understanding the old body shape),
  `@flama/frontend-core` exposes `toAppError` and the `@MapApiError` method decorator so screens can show
  the server's `detail` and per-field errors, and `ApiProblemResponse` puts the
  schema in the OpenAPI document and the generated client.

- f96d51a: Add server-evaluated feature flags, wired into the API, web and mobile.

  Flags are declared in code, targeted in the database, evaluated on the server
  and read on every client from one endpoint — the shape Stripe and Revolut
  describe for their own.

  - **`@flama/shared`** gains `feature-flags/`: the `FEATURE_FLAGS` catalog
    (every flag the code may read, with its kind, owner, safe default and — for
    temporary flags — expiry), the pure evaluator (ordered rules, segments,
    semver targeting on the app build, deterministic MurmurHash3 percentage
    splits bucketed by organization), and the Zod schemas for targeting writes.
    `@flama/shared/feature-flags/catalog` is a Zod-free subpath for the web
    bundle. A `flags` scope group and a `FeatureFlag` subject join the catalogs.
  - **`@flama/api`** gains a `feature-flags` module. Every replica holds all
    targeting in memory and evaluates without I/O, polling a cheap fingerprint
    to stay in sync and keeping its last good snapshot through a database blip.
    `GET /v1/feature-flags` serves the caller's evaluated client flags (signed
    out too); the control-plane endpoints under `/v1/feature-flags/admin`,
    `/segments` and `/changes` edit targeting, pull kill switches, manage
    segments, explain an evaluation and read the audit trail, which every change
    lands on through the outbox. `@RequireFlag('key')` gates a route on a flag,
    and token creation is now behind the `api_token_creation` kill switch. New
    error codes `FLAG_001`–`FLAG_007`. Migration `AddFeatureFlags`.
  - **`@flama/frontend-core`**: a `feature-flags` kernel module and
    `useFeatureFlag` / `useFeatureFlagValue` / `useFeatureFlags`, typed by the
    catalog, reading the API rather than PostHog. Flags are prefetched as soon as
    the session is known, persisted with the query cache, and an `experiment`
    flag records a `feature_flag_exposed` event. `FlamaApp.create` takes
    `featureFlags: { platform, appVersion }`.

    **Breaking:** feature flags leave the analytics port. `IAnalyticsClient` no
    longer has `getFeatureFlags` / `onFeatureFlags`, `AnalyticsService` no longer
    serves flags, `analyticsKeys.flags` is gone, and `isFlagEnabled` moved to the
    `feature-flags` module. `useFeatureFlag(key)` keeps its name but now takes a
    catalog key and reads the server's answer.

  - **`@flama/frontend-web` / `@flama/frontend-mobile`**: the PostHog adapters
    drop their flag methods and switch PostHog's own flag loading off. The mobile
    query client now follows `AppState`, so `refetchOnWindowFocus` works on a
    phone and a pulled kill switch lands when the app returns to the foreground.
    The unused `featureFlags` section of the mobile remote config is removed:
    remote config is for tunables, not flags.
  - **`@flama/web` / `@flama/mobile`** report their platform and build, and the
    web API-tokens screen reads `api_token_creation`.

  `pnpm check:flags` (in CI) fails on a temporary flag past its expiry date and
  on a flag the catalog declares but no code reads.

- e6895ae: Describe scope and permission-catalog responses properly in OpenAPI, so the
  generated client carries their real types.

  Several response DTOs described themselves loosely enough that the generated
  client lost the type and every consumer had to cast it back:

  - Scope arrays (`ApiTokenResponseDto.scopes`, `PermissionCatalogResponseDto.grantable`,
    `CurrentCredentialResponseDto.grantedScopes` / `effectiveScopes`) were declared
    `type: [String]` and generated as `string[]`. They now declare `enum: SCOPES`,
    so the client sees the same 20-member union the request DTO already used.
  - `PermissionCatalogResponseDto.groups` was an untyped object array and generated
    as `Record<string, any>[]`. The catalog now has real DTOs — `PermissionGroupDto`,
    `ScopeLevelsDto`, `ScopeLevelDto`, `ScopePolicyDto` — mirroring `PermissionGroup`
    from `@flama/shared`, so drift between the two becomes a compile error.
  - `GET /v1/users` declared no response schema at all and generated as `any`, taking
    the whole paginated list with it. It now returns `PaginatedUsersResponseDto`
    (with `PaginationMetaDto`).

  The wire format is unchanged — only its description. `@flama/frontend-consumer`'s
  api-tokens repository drops the casts this forced (including a `dto as never`
  that was disabling type checking on the create-token request body) and reads
  the generated DTOs directly. In `@flama/frontend-core`,
  `UsersRepository.findAll` / `UsersService.findAll` widen their `role` filter
  from `'admin' | 'user'` to `Role`, matching the database-backed roles the API
  actually accepts.

  The root `generate:openapi` script ran `nest build` from the repo root, where
  there is no Nest workspace, so `pnpm generate:api-client` always failed; it now
  delegates to `@flama/api`.

### Patch Changes

- af46e89: Bring every user-facing error into the RFC 7807 catalog.

  The organization and admin façades threw bare `HttpException`s carrying Better
  Auth's `{ message, code }` body, expecting the code to survive. It did not:
  `AllExceptionsFilter` reads a `code` from `AppError` alone, so ~46 call sites
  answered with a codeless problem document whose `title` was only the status
  phrase ("Conflict"). The auth guards had the same gap.

  - **`@flama/backend-core`** — new `ApiAuthProblemResponses()` documents the
    401/403 every guarded route can produce, applied once per controller class.
    A test now pins the deliberate rule that a bare `HttpException` carries no
    `code`.
  - **`apps/api`** — new `AuthErrors` (`AUTH_001`/`AUTH_002`), `OrganizationErrors`
    (`ORG_001`–`ORG_016`) and `AdminErrors` (`ADMIN_001`–`ADMIN_008`) catalogs.
    `betterAuthInvoker` folds Better Auth's ~85 upstream codes onto them, keeping
    the original as an `upstreamCode` extension member. Guards throw catalog
    errors instead of Nest's codeless ones; `PoliciesGuard` now reports a missing
    principal as 401 rather than 403.
  - **`@flama/translations`** — new `errors` namespace with a message per code in
    both locales, so clients stop rendering the server's English `detail`.
  - **`@flama/frontend-core`** — new `createErrorMessageResolver` translating a
    failure from its problem `code`.
  - **`@flama/frontend-consumer`** — the organizations repository no longer
    swallows a failed read into an empty list.
  - **`@flama/api-client`** — regenerated; the documented failures now reach the
    OpenAPI document.

- c432cff: `GET /v1/organizations/:orgId/members/me` answers for the organization in the
  path, not the session's active one, and organization-scoped routes are
  authorized by the caller's roles in the path's organization. The client
  method is now `getMembership(orgId)` (the SDK's `getMembership({ path: { orgId } })`),
  with `orgId` required.
- 48d1b41: Make the web delivery path carry its weight: compression, caching, a real CSP,
  and a budget that keeps first load honest.

  The built SPAs were served by a 14-line nginx config that set none of the three
  things nginx does not do by default. The official image ships `gzip` commented
  out, so the ~1.1MB entry chunk went over the wire uncompressed; hashed assets
  got no `Cache-Control`, so every repeat visit revalidated all ~50 chunks; and
  the Content-Security-Policy that `index.html` and `public/theme-init.js` were
  already written against — both keep the theme bootstrap in a separate file
  specifically to avoid an inline-script exception — did not exist. All three are
  now set, with the policy's third-party origins in one substituted
  `CSP_EXTRA_ORIGINS` variable (defaulted in the Dockerfile, overridable per
  deployment through `helm/flama/values.yaml`). Measured on the current build:
  1,130KB → 324KB for the entry chunk, 152KB → 24KB for the stylesheet.

  On the critical path itself:

  - **Only the default locale is bundled.** `@flama/translations` grew two
    narrower entrypoints — `/locales` for metadata and `/lazy` for one catalog per
    chunk — because importing `locales` or `Messages` from the root barrel put
    every catalog in the entry chunk. The Spanish catalog was measurably inside
    what an English reader downloaded before anything rendered.
  - **The session lookup starts before the bundle parses.** Nothing renders until
    `useSessionRestore` resolves, and that request used to begin only after the
    bundle had downloaded, parsed and mounted React. `public/session-preload.js`
    issues it from `<head>`; `consumeSessionPreload` in `@flama/auth` takes the
    answer once, and falls back to the auth client for anything unusable, so the
    worst case is a wasted request rather than a reader treated as signed out.
  - **Route chunks are prefetched on intent.** `defaultPreload: 'intent'` means
    hovering a link fetches the route it points at, instead of every navigation
    starting a request.
  - **Dependencies are chunked per library** via a shared
    `@flama/tsconfig/vite-chunks.mjs`, so a release invalidates app code (42KB) and
    leaves the vendor chunks cached (263KB). Splitting costs ~48KB gzipped on a
    cold first load, which is the trade the `immutable` caching above pays for —
    the number is recorded in that file.
  - `sideEffects` declared on `@flama/design-system-web` (CSS excepted),
    `@flama/translations` and `@flama/api-client`, worth ~7KB gzipped.

  And so it stays fixed: `pnpm check:bundle` gzips everything the built
  `index.html` references and fails past a committed budget, in CI after
  `pnpm build`. Vite's own 500KB warning prints and passes, which is how a 1.1MB
  entry chunk went unnoticed. The Playwright `api` project runs in CI too — 69
  specs that existed and that no job ran, five of which had been failing since the
  console mailbox line gained a `Locale:` segment the e2e helper never learned
  about. The `web` project stays out until it is repaired: it drives a `/team`
  route `apps/web` no longer has, and 15 of its 64 specs fail on `main`. See
  `e2e/README.md`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e209380: Add a CLI and an MCP server, both governed by granular per-credential
  permissions.

  Authorization gains a second layer. Roles say what a _person_ may do; **scopes**
  say what a _credential_ may do on their behalf, and the two are intersected on
  every request. A token can never be minted with more reach than its creator
  has, and revoking someone's role immediately narrows every credential they
  issued.

  - **`@flama/shared`**: the scope catalog — nine permission groups
    (profile, users, admin, roles, organizations, members, invitations,
    workspaces, tokens), each with a Read and an Edit level backed by the CASL
    rules it authorizes. Helpers for parsing, the write ⇒ read implication, the
    OAuth string form, and `grantableScopes`/`ungrantableScopes`, which enforce
    the "never exceed your creator" rule. Plus `ResourceScope` for per-organization
    narrowing, Zod schemas for token creation, and an `ApiToken` subject with
    own-token permissions on the seeded `user` role.

  - **`@flama/api`**: a new `api-tokens` DDD module (Better Auth 1.6 no longer
    ships an apiKey plugin). Only a SHA-256 digest of each secret is stored;
    tokens support expiry, IP allowlists and organization scoping, and are revoked
    rather than deleted. `ApiAuthGuard` replaces Better Auth's cookie-only guard
    and accepts a session cookie, an API token or an OAuth access token;
    `ScopesGuard` is registered globally and fails closed, so a route that
    declares no `@RequireScopes` cannot be reached by a token at all. The MCP
    plugin adds OAuth 2.1 discovery, dynamic client registration and a consent
    page. New endpoints: `GET|POST /v1/tokens`, `DELETE /v1/tokens/:id`,
    `GET /v1/tokens/permissions` and `GET /v1/me/credential`.

  - **`@flama/mcp`** (new): an MCP server exposing 26 tools over stdio and
    Streamable HTTP from one registry. Tools declare the scopes they need and the
    tool list is filtered by the credential's effective scopes, so an agent is
    never shown a capability that would be refused.

  - **`@flama/cli`** (new): `flama` — login that trades a session for a scoped
    token, token management with a permission catalog, users/roles/orgs/workspaces
    commands, `--json` output, profiles, and `flama mcp install` to connect an
    agent.

  - **`@flama/web`** / **`@flama/frontend`** / **`@flama/translations`**: a
    token-creation screen with a per-resource permission picker (levels you cannot
    grant are disabled) and an OAuth consent screen, backed by new `api-tokens`
    and `organizations` modules with TanStack Query hooks.

  Deploying runs a migration that adds the `api_token` and OAuth tables and grants
  every user permission over their own tokens. `pnpm generate:api-client` no
  longer needs a running database.
