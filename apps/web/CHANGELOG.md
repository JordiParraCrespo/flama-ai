### Minor Changes

- f96d51a: Add server-evaluated feature flags, wired into the API, web and mobile.

  Flags are declared in code, targeted in the database, evaluated on the server
  and read on every client from one endpoint — the shape Stripe and Revolut
  describe for their own.

  - **`@flama/shared`** gains `feature-flags/`: the `FEATURE_FLAGS` catalog
    (every flag the code may read, with its kind, owner, safe default and — for
    temporary flags — expiry), the pure evaluator (ordered rules, segments,
    semver targeting on the app build, deterministic MurmurHash3 percentage
    splits bucketed by organization), and the Zod schemas for targeting writes.
    `@flama/shared/feature-flags/catalog` is a Zod-free subpath for the web
    bundle. A `flags` scope group and a `FeatureFlag` subject join the catalogs.
  - **`@flama/api`** gains a `feature-flags` module. Every replica holds all
    targeting in memory and evaluates without I/O, polling a cheap fingerprint
    to stay in sync and keeping its last good snapshot through a database blip.
    `GET /v1/feature-flags` serves the caller's evaluated client flags (signed
    out too); the control-plane endpoints under `/v1/feature-flags/admin`,
    `/segments` and `/changes` edit targeting, pull kill switches, manage
    segments, explain an evaluation and read the audit trail, which every change
    lands on through the outbox. `@RequireFlag('key')` gates a route on a flag,
    and token creation is now behind the `api_token_creation` kill switch. New
    error codes `FLAG_001`–`FLAG_007`. Migration `AddFeatureFlags`.
  - **`@flama/frontend-core`**: a `feature-flags` kernel module and
    `useFeatureFlag` / `useFeatureFlagValue` / `useFeatureFlags`, typed by the
    catalog, reading the API rather than PostHog. Flags are prefetched as soon as
    the session is known, persisted with the query cache, and an `experiment`
    flag records a `feature_flag_exposed` event. `FlamaApp.create` takes
    `featureFlags: { platform, appVersion }`.

    **Breaking:** feature flags leave the analytics port. `IAnalyticsClient` no
    longer has `getFeatureFlags` / `onFeatureFlags`, `AnalyticsService` no longer
    serves flags, `analyticsKeys.flags` is gone, and `isFlagEnabled` moved to the
    `feature-flags` module. `useFeatureFlag(key)` keeps its name but now takes a
    catalog key and reads the server's answer.

  - **`@flama/frontend-web` / `@flama/frontend-mobile`**: the PostHog adapters
    drop their flag methods and switch PostHog's own flag loading off. The mobile
    query client now follows `AppState`, so `refetchOnWindowFocus` works on a
    phone and a pulled kill switch lands when the app returns to the foreground.
    The unused `featureFlags` section of the mobile remote config is removed:
    remote config is for tunables, not flags.
  - **`@flama/web` / `@flama/mobile`** report their platform and build, and the
    web API-tokens screen reads `api_token_creation`.

  `pnpm check:flags` (in CI) fails on a temporary flag past its expiry date and
  on a flag the catalog declares but no code reads.

- 48d1b41: Make the web delivery path carry its weight: compression, caching, a real CSP,
  and a budget that keeps first load honest.

  The built SPAs were served by a 14-line nginx config that set none of the three
  things nginx does not do by default. The official image ships `gzip` commented
  out, so the ~1.1MB entry chunk went over the wire uncompressed; hashed assets
  got no `Cache-Control`, so every repeat visit revalidated all ~50 chunks; and
  the Content-Security-Policy that `index.html` and `public/theme-init.js` were
  already written against — both keep the theme bootstrap in a separate file
  specifically to avoid an inline-script exception — did not exist. All three are
  now set, with the policy's third-party origins in one substituted
  `CSP_EXTRA_ORIGINS` variable (defaulted in the Dockerfile, overridable per
  deployment through `helm/flama/values.yaml`). Measured on the current build:
  1,130KB → 324KB for the entry chunk, 152KB → 24KB for the stylesheet.

  On the critical path itself:

  - **Only the default locale is bundled.** `@flama/translations` grew two
    narrower entrypoints — `/locales` for metadata and `/lazy` for one catalog per
    chunk — because importing `locales` or `Messages` from the root barrel put
    every catalog in the entry chunk. The Spanish catalog was measurably inside
    what an English reader downloaded before anything rendered.
  - **The session lookup starts before the bundle parses.** Nothing renders until
    `useSessionRestore` resolves, and that request used to begin only after the
    bundle had downloaded, parsed and mounted React. `public/session-preload.js`
    issues it from `<head>`; `consumeSessionPreload` in `@flama/auth` takes the
    answer once, and falls back to the auth client for anything unusable, so the
    worst case is a wasted request rather than a reader treated as signed out.
  - **Route chunks are prefetched on intent.** `defaultPreload: 'intent'` means
    hovering a link fetches the route it points at, instead of every navigation
    starting a request.
  - **Dependencies are chunked per library** via a shared
    `@flama/tsconfig/vite-chunks.mjs`, so a release invalidates app code (42KB) and
    leaves the vendor chunks cached (263KB). Splitting costs ~48KB gzipped on a
    cold first load, which is the trade the `immutable` caching above pays for —
    the number is recorded in that file.
  - `sideEffects` declared on `@flama/design-system-web` (CSS excepted),
    `@flama/translations` and `@flama/api-client`, worth ~7KB gzipped.

  And so it stays fixed: `pnpm check:bundle` gzips everything the built
  `index.html` references and fails past a committed budget, in CI after
  `pnpm build`. Vite's own 500KB warning prints and passes, which is how a 1.1MB
  entry chunk went unnoticed. The Playwright `api` project runs in CI too — 69
  specs that existed and that no job ran, five of which had been failing since the
  console mailbox line gained a `Locale:` segment the e2e helper never learned
  about. The `web` project stays out until it is repaired: it drives a `/team`
  route `apps/web` no longer has, and 15 of its 64 specs fail on `main`. See
  `e2e/README.md`.

### Patch Changes

- 396c114: Put everything before the console under one `_auth` layout, and let each route
  say for itself who may reach it.

  `_auth` used to be chrome _and_ a gate: it mounted `AuthLayout` and called
  `redirectSignedIn`, so every route beneath it had to be a signed-out route.
  Two things did not fit. `accept-invitation` is reachable by a signed-out
  invitee _and_ a signed-in one, which the guard handled with an exception —
  `allow: ['/accept-invitation']`. And `/onboarding`, which only a signed-in
  account should see, could not live under that layout at all, so it sat outside
  with its own copy of the layout's chrome.

  Now `_auth` renders and guards nothing, and its three children each answer for
  themselves: `_auth/_public.tsx` turns signed-in visitors away,
  `_auth/onboarding.tsx` turns signed-out ones away, and
  `_auth/accept-invitation.tsx` carries no guard because both are legitimate
  there.

  **`redirectSignedIn` drops its `allow` parameter.** An exception list beside a
  guard is a second copy of the tree and can drift from the paths it names; a
  route both readers may open belongs under a parent that guards nobody, which
  cannot. Nothing passed `allow` any more, and leaving it exported is how the
  next route that "does not fit" gets appended to it instead of placed.

  **`redirectSignedOut` joins it**, so the pair is symmetric. Three routes had
  each written the signed-out bounce inline — both apps' `_authenticated` and
  the onboarding step — and with it the `/login` target and the reason it sends
  `location.href` rather than `location.pathname`. Now a route picks one guard,
  the other, or neither.

  The onboarding screen had hand-rolled the auth column: the same padding, the
  same theme toggle in the same corner, the same 400px measure. It renders in
  the real layout now and its wrapper is a fragment.

  Every URL is unchanged — `/login`, `/register`, `/forgot-password`,
  `/reset-password`, `/accept-invitation` and `/onboarding` all resolve exactly
  as before.

- 548b754: Stripe billing leaves the starter for the `billing` plugin, and the `leads`
  example is removed.

  - `@flama/api` no longer ships `BillingModule`, its migrations, the `stripe`
    config or the `stripe` dependency, and no longer ships `LeadsModule`.
    `pnpm plugin:add billing` puts billing back, then
    `pnpm generate:api-client`.
  - `@flama/shared` drops the `billing` and `leads` scope resources and
    permission groups, the `stripe_billing` capability, the `Billing` subject,
    the `/billing/subscriptions` endpoint policy and the billing and lead schemas.
  - `@flama/api-client` drops the billing and leads endpoints and models. Its
    legacy models now take `Scope`, `ScopeResource` and `ClientCapabilities` from
    `@flama/shared` instead of spelling them out. `openapi-ts` reads
    `apps/api/openapi.json` from the right path again, so `src/generated` is
    regenerated.
  - `@flama/translations` drops the `BILLING_*` and `LEAD_*` error copy; the
    plugin carries the billing copy.
  - `@flama/web`'s permission picker gives a resource without an icon of its own
    a generic key icon, so a plugin's scope group renders without an edit here.

- 28b2d1b: Extract the Better Auth configuration both sides must agree on into a new `@flama/auth` package: the user-fields schema (consumed by the server's `user.additionalFields` and the clients' `inferAdditionalFields`), the shared client plugin set (`admin`, `organization` with the `teams` flag), and the `unwrap()` / `toAuthSession()` helpers previously copy-pasted into both client adapters. The `./client` entry ships TypeScript sources to preserve Better Auth's type inference; the root entry is compiled CJS for the NestJS API.
- 25ff19f: One `.env` at the repo root, documented by a root `.env.example`.

  New `@flama/env` package locates the workspace root (walking up to
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml` or a `package.json` with `workspaces`), loads `.env`
  then `.env.local` (local wins between the files), and never overwrites a
  value already in `process.env` — real environment variables always win, so
  the same loader is correct in CI and in production containers.

  - `apps/api` entry points (`main.ts`, TypeORM CLI `data-source.ts`, seed,
    OpenAPI generation, `auth.ts`) import `@flama/env/load` instead of
    `dotenv/config`, which resolved `.env` against `process.cwd()`. The TypeORM
    CLI previously loaded no env file at all.
  - `apps/web` reads the root file via Vite's `envDir`; a `.env` inside the app
    directory is no longer read.
  - `apps/mobile` loads the root file in `app.config.ts` before Metro bundles,
    and its deep-link `scheme` now reads `MOBILE_SCHEME` — the same variable the
    API uses for its trusted origin — instead of a hardcoded copy.
  - `apps/mcp` entry points load the root file too (a no-op outside a
    workspace), and the HTTP port now prefers `MCP_PORT` over `PORT` so a shared
    root `.env` can't make it collide with the API.
  - Stale variables removed: the `JWT_SECRET` fallback for `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
    and `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in
    `docker/docker-compose.prod.yml` (which now passes `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` /
    `BETTER_AUTH_URL`); `SENTRY_DSN` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` were documented
    but never read and are not carried over.

  The three per-app `.env.example` files are replaced by a single root
  `.env.example` documenting every variable the repo reads.

- d06200f: Name the config package after what it holds, and put the endpoint policies next
  to CASL.

  `@flama/config` is now `@flama/tsconfig`, in `packages/tsconfig/`. "Config" said
  nothing — the repo has seven other things that answer to it (`src/config/` in
  the API, `ShellConfig`, `vite.config.ts`, the root `.env`) — while the package
  holds tsconfig presets and the two build-time helpers that travel with them
  (`vite-chunks.mjs`, `depcruise/*.cjs`). Every `extends`, devDependency,
  Dockerfile `COPY` and doc reference moved with it; nothing else changed.

  `@flama/shared` no longer exports `./navigation`. `SCREENS` paired a web route
  (`/team`, `/api-tokens`) with the endpoint behind it and the rules that endpoint
  demands. The endpoint half is a real contract and stays, as `ENDPOINT_POLICIES`
  in `@flama/shared/permissions` — keyed by the path Nest mounts the handler at,
  which is what `apps/api/src/auth/__tests__/endpoint-policies.spec.ts` (renamed
  from `screen-policies.spec.ts`) pins the controllers to.

  The route half is deleted rather than rehoused. Those five paths are not routes
  any app mounts: `apps/web` serves `/dashboard`, `/settings` and
  `/settings/api-tokens`, `apps/admin-web` serves `/users` and `/roles`, and
  neither read the catalog — both nav files write their rows out by hand. A list
  of one product's leftover URLs does not earn a home in the platform kit both
  Vite apps compile. The rule that survives is smaller and is now what the docs
  say: a gated nav row takes `policies: ENDPOINT_POLICIES['/tokens']` where the
  row is declared, never a literal rule list, and the route string stays in the
  app that mounts it.

  The catalog also carries its own invariants now. `ENDPOINT_POLICIES` is typed
  `Record<string, readonly [EndpointPolicy, ...EndpointPolicy[]]>`, so an empty
  rule list and a misspelled member are both compile errors — which is what the
  package-local spec was asserting at runtime, so it is gone. `HANDLERS` in the
  API test is a `Record<GuardedEndpoint, …>`, so a new catalog entry fails to
  compile until a handler is named for it. Nothing casts.

  `permissions/index.ts` became a barrel over `abilities.ts` (a verbatim move of
  the old file) and `endpoint-policies.ts`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e209380: Add a CLI and an MCP server, both governed by granular per-credential
  permissions.

  Authorization gains a second layer. Roles say what a _person_ may do; **scopes**
  say what a _credential_ may do on their behalf, and the two are intersected on
  every request. A token can never be minted with more reach than its creator
  has, and revoking someone's role immediately narrows every credential they
  issued.

  - **`@flama/shared`**: the scope catalog — nine permission groups
    (profile, users, admin, roles, organizations, members, invitations,
    workspaces, tokens), each with a Read and an Edit level backed by the CASL
    rules it authorizes. Helpers for parsing, the write ⇒ read implication, the
    OAuth string form, and `grantableScopes`/`ungrantableScopes`, which enforce
    the "never exceed your creator" rule. Plus `ResourceScope` for per-organization
    narrowing, Zod schemas for token creation, and an `ApiToken` subject with
    own-token permissions on the seeded `user` role.

  - **`@flama/api`**: a new `api-tokens` DDD module (Better Auth 1.6 no longer
    ships an apiKey plugin). Only a SHA-256 digest of each secret is stored;
    tokens support expiry, IP allowlists and organization scoping, and are revoked
    rather than deleted. `ApiAuthGuard` replaces Better Auth's cookie-only guard
    and accepts a session cookie, an API token or an OAuth access token;
    `ScopesGuard` is registered globally and fails closed, so a route that
    declares no `@RequireScopes` cannot be reached by a token at all. The MCP
    plugin adds OAuth 2.1 discovery, dynamic client registration and a consent
    page. New endpoints: `GET|POST /v1/tokens`, `DELETE /v1/tokens/:id`,
    `GET /v1/tokens/permissions` and `GET /v1/me/credential`.

  - **`@flama/mcp`** (new): an MCP server exposing 26 tools over stdio and
    Streamable HTTP from one registry. Tools declare the scopes they need and the
    tool list is filtered by the credential's effective scopes, so an agent is
    never shown a capability that would be refused.

  - **`@flama/cli`** (new): `flama` — login that trades a session for a scoped
    token, token management with a permission catalog, users/roles/orgs/workspaces
    commands, `--json` output, profiles, and `flama mcp install` to connect an
    agent.

  - **`@flama/web`** / **`@flama/frontend`** / **`@flama/translations`**: a
    token-creation screen with a per-resource permission picker (levels you cannot
    grant are disabled) and an OAuth consent screen, backed by new `api-tokens`
    and `organizations` modules with TanStack Query hooks.

  Deploying runs a migration that adds the `api_token` and OAuth tables and grants
  every user permission over their own tokens. `pnpm generate:api-client` no
  longer needs a running database.
