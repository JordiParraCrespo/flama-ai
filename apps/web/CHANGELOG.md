# @flama/web

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 28b2d1b: Extract the Better Auth configuration both sides must agree on into a new `@flama/auth` package: the user-fields schema (consumed by the server's `user.additionalFields` and the clients' `inferAdditionalFields`), the shared client plugin set (`admin`, `organization` with the `teams` flag), and the `unwrap()` / `toAuthSession()` helpers previously copy-pasted into both client adapters. The `./client` entry ships TypeScript sources to preserve Better Auth's type inference; the root entry is compiled CJS for the NestJS API.
- 25ff19f: One `.env` at the repo root, documented by a root `.env.example`.

  New `@flama/env` package locates the workspace root (walking up to
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml` or a `package.json` with `workspaces`), loads `.env`
  then `.env.local` (local wins between the files), and never overwrites a
  value already in `process.env` — real environment variables always win, so
  the same loader is correct in CI and in production containers.

  - `apps/api` entry points (`main.ts`, TypeORM CLI `data-source.ts`, seed,
    OpenAPI generation, `auth.ts`) import `@flama/env/load` instead of
    `dotenv/config`, which resolved `.env` against `process.cwd()`. The TypeORM
    CLI previously loaded no env file at all.
  - `apps/web` reads the root file via Vite's `envDir`; a `.env` inside the app
    directory is no longer read.
  - `apps/mobile` loads the root file in `app.config.ts` before Metro bundles,
    and its deep-link `scheme` now reads `MOBILE_SCHEME` — the same variable the
    API uses for its trusted origin — instead of a hardcoded copy.
  - `apps/mcp` entry points load the root file too (a no-op outside a
    workspace), and the HTTP port now prefers `MCP_PORT` over `PORT` so a shared
    root `.env` can't make it collide with the API.
  - Stale variables removed: the `JWT_SECRET` fallback for `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
    and `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in
    `docker/docker-compose.prod.yml` (which now passes `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` /
    `BETTER_AUTH_URL`); `SENTRY_DSN` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` were documented
    but never read and are not carried over.

  The three per-app `.env.example` files are replaced by a single root
  `.env.example` documenting every variable the repo reads.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e209380: Add a CLI and an MCP server, both governed by granular per-credential
  permissions.

  Authorization gains a second layer. Roles say what a _person_ may do; **scopes**
  say what a _credential_ may do on their behalf, and the two are intersected on
  every request. A token can never be minted with more reach than its creator
  has, and revoking someone's role immediately narrows every credential they
  issued.

  - **`@flama/shared`**: the scope catalog — nine permission groups
    (profile, users, admin, roles, organizations, members, invitations,
    workspaces, tokens), each with a Read and an Edit level backed by the CASL
    rules it authorizes. Helpers for parsing, the write ⇒ read implication, the
    OAuth string form, and `grantableScopes`/`ungrantableScopes`, which enforce
    the "never exceed your creator" rule. Plus `ResourceScope` for per-organization
    narrowing, Zod schemas for token creation, and an `ApiToken` subject with
    own-token permissions on the seeded `user` role.

  - **`@flama/api`**: a new `api-tokens` DDD module (Better Auth 1.6 no longer
    ships an apiKey plugin). Only a SHA-256 digest of each secret is stored;
    tokens support expiry, IP allowlists and organization scoping, and are revoked
    rather than deleted. `ApiAuthGuard` replaces Better Auth's cookie-only guard
    and accepts a session cookie, an API token or an OAuth access token;
    `ScopesGuard` is registered globally and fails closed, so a route that
    declares no `@RequireScopes` cannot be reached by a token at all. The MCP
    plugin adds OAuth 2.1 discovery, dynamic client registration and a consent
    page. New endpoints: `GET|POST /v1/tokens`, `DELETE /v1/tokens/:id`,
    `GET /v1/tokens/permissions` and `GET /v1/me/credential`.

  - **`@flama/mcp`** (new): an MCP server exposing 26 tools over stdio and
    Streamable HTTP from one registry. Tools declare the scopes they need and the
    tool list is filtered by the credential's effective scopes, so an agent is
    never shown a capability that would be refused.

  - **`@flama/cli`** (new): `flama` — login that trades a session for a scoped
    token, token management with a permission catalog, users/roles/orgs/workspaces
    commands, `--json` output, profiles, and `flama mcp install` to connect an
    agent.

  - **`@flama/web`** / **`@flama/frontend`** / **`@flama/translations`**: a
    token-creation screen with a per-resource permission picker (levels you cannot
    grant are disabled) and an OAuth consent screen, backed by new `api-tokens`
    and `organizations` modules with TanStack Query hooks.

  Deploying runs a migration that adds the `api_token` and OAuth tables and grants
  every user permission over their own tokens. `pnpm generate:api-client` no
  longer needs a running database.
